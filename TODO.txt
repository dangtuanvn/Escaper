------------------------------------------------------
Can be improved:

Window size: Current window size is fixed and may not be displayed properly on different screen size.
	Make the window be able to scale?

Die action: more animations, move the player?

Dynamic Entity: modify method Patrol() for it to be universal, making it possible to call this method
	to get an object to patrol on X-axis or Y-axis or even in a circle instead of writing different
	patrol methods for each object.

Redesign input: combine input from class World and Player or split Input to another class,
	as of now, whenever the game is paused, the getInput() from class Player is inaccessible 
	because EntityManager is not updating. In order to unpause, the input must come from
	class World. However, due to many direct use of class Player's variables in getInput(),
	moving getInput() to another class would require excessive amount of accessors.

Entity collision: collision check between other entities if needed? The current code only check
	for collision between the player and other entities, which mean other entities don't touch
	each other. Because more checks mean more resources require, meanwhile there is no use for such
	system at the moment.

	Change to Quadtree collision check?	

Gravity: Gravity is only applied on the Player for now. As above, there is no need for gravity to apply 
	to all entities yet.
